# MOAAPP - Multi-Objective Attention-Based Adaptive Path Planner (UAV Path Planning) ðŸš€

This project implements a **UAV path planning system** using **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** combined with **LSTM** and **Attention mechanisms** for reinforcement learning. It leverages the AirSim simulation environment to enhance the UAV's ability to navigate in complex, obstacle-rich environments, optimizing multiple objectives like path length, safety, and energy efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Deep Q-Learning with LSTM and Attention**: A reinforcement learning model that adapts UAV path planning by learning the best actions through an attention-enhanced LSTM network.
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Simultaneously optimizes for multiple goals like minimizing path length, avoiding obstacles, and maximizing energy efficiency.
- **Dynamic Attention Mechanism**: Attention layers help the model focus on the most relevant environmental features during the decision-making process.
- **Integration with AirSim**: Uses Microsoft's AirSim platform to simulate complex UAV navigation environments.
- **Safety Checker & Collision Avoidance**: Monitors and prevents collisions using lidar data and obstacle detection.
